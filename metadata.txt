name=Continuous Network Analysis (Processing)
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Processing plugin that adds several scripts to assist in decision making and validation of line-type vector networks by generating inconsistencies, further expanding the “Network Analysis” tool.

about=	-The plugin focuses on analyzing vector networks. The plugin offers a range of procedures for analyzing line-type vector networks. The procedures are:
	
	🔹Attribute Discontinuity Detector.
		*It performs a series of processes to identify discontinuities of a selected attribute within a line-type vector network and generates a file that points out the attribute discontinuities along the network.
	🔹Dangle Analysis.
		*Identifies dangles (line sections that do not connect to other lines) in a vector network layer and checks the overlap of these dangles with several layers selected by the user.
	🔹Extract Springs.
		*The program performs a series of processes to identify and extract sources from a vector network.
	🔹Identify Dangles.
		*Finds dangles (loose ends) in a line type layer
	🔹Disconnected Network Segments.
		*Performs a series of procedures to verify the topological connectivity of a line layer from an initial layer.
	🔹Pseudo-node.
		*Identifies pseudo-nodes in a line layer and returns points with the attributes of the two segments connected at that node.
	🔹Pseudo-node Analysis.
		*It analyzes whether the breaks (Pseudo-node) are topologically connected to the vertices of the layers that the user selected.
	🔹Vertex Connection Counter.
		*Calculates which vertices in a line network are connected to other vertices, and how many connections each has.
